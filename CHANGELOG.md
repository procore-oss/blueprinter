## 1.1.2 - 2024/10/3
- 🐛 [BUGFIX] Fixes an issue where a `Blueprinter::BlueprinterError` would be raised on render when providing `view: nil`, instead of falling back on the `:default` view. See
[#472](https://github.com/procore-oss/blueprinter/pull/472). Thanks to [@lessthanjacob](https://github.com/lessthanjacob).

## 1.1.1 - 2024/10/2
* 🐛 [BUGFIX] Fixes an issue when when calling `.render` multiple times on a Blueprint using the same `options` hash, which would result in the `options` changing unexpectedly between calls. See [#453](https://github.com/procore-oss/blueprinter/pull/453). Thanks to [@ryanmccarthypdx](https://github.com/ryanmccarthypdx).
* 🐛 [BUGFIX] Fixes an issue when passing in a `Symbol` (representing a method) to the `if:` condition on an association. The provided `Symbol` would be erroneously sent to the association's Blueprint, instead of the Blueprint in which the association was defined within. See [#464](https://github.com/procore-oss/blueprinter/pull/464). Thanks to [@lessthanjacob](https://github.com/lessthanjacob).

* 🚜 [REFACTOR] Adds explicit dependency on `json` within `Blueprinter::Configuration`. See [#444](https://github.com/procore-oss/blueprinter/pull/444). Thanks to [@lessthanjacob](https://github.com/lessthanjacob).
* 🚜 [REFACTOR] Alters file loading to leverage `autoload` instead of `require` for (future) optional, top-level constants. See [#445](https://github.com/procore-oss/blueprinter/pull/445). Thanks to [@jhollinger](https://github.com/jhollinger).

## 1.0.2 - 2024/02/02
