    # blueprint_fields: Returns the fields that should be included in the correct order. Default is all fields in the order
    # in which they were defined.

    # and cache them in context.data, so we don't have to recalculate them for every field.

    # used as the input to the Blueprint.
    # @param context [Blueprinter::V2::Context::Object]

    # extract_value: Extract a field, objecet, or collection value from an object. The returned value will be run through the
    # NOTE If there are multiple extract_value hooks, only the last one is called.
    # field_value, object_fled_value, or collection_fled_value hooks.

    # @return [Object]

    # the object's Blueprint.
    # @param context [Blueprinter::V2::Context::Field]
    # @return [Object]

    # collection_field_value: Modify or replace the value used for the collection. The returned value will be used as the
    # input for the collection's Blueprint.

    # json: Override the default JSON encoder. The returned string will be the JSON output.

    # around_hook: Instrument extension hook calls. MUST yield!
    # @param extension [Blueprinter::Extension] Instance of the extension
    # @param hook [Symbol] Name of hook being called

    # pre_render: Called eary during "render" in V1, this method receives the object to be rendered and
    # may return a modified (or new) object to be rendered.
    # @param object [Object] The object to be rendered
    # @param blueprint [Class] The Blueprinter class
    # @param view [Symbol] The blueprint view
    # @param options [Hash] Options passed to "render"
    # @return [Object] The object to continue rendering
