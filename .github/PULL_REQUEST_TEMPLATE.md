Note on DCO:

If the DCO check fails, one or more of your commits are not signed off. Please click on the *Details* link next to the DCO action for instructions on how to resolve this.

Note on Versioning:

Maintainers will bump the version and do a release when they are ready to release (possibly multiple merged PRs). Please do not bump the version in your PRs.
