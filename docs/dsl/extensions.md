# Extensions

Blueprinter has a powerful extension system with hooks for every step of the serialization lifecycle. Some are included with Blueprinter, others are available as gems, and you can easily write your own using the [Extension API](../api/extensions.md).

## Using extensions

Extensions can be added to your `ApplicationBlueprint` or any other blueprint, view, or partial. They're inherited from parent classes and views, but can be overridden.

```ruby
class MyBlueprint < ApplicationBlueprint
  # This extension instance will exist for the duration of your program
  extensions << FooExtension.new

  # These extensions will be initialized once during each render
  extensions << BarExtension
  extensions << -> { ZorpExtension.new(some_args) }

  # Inline extensions are also initialized once per render
  extension do
    def blueprint_output(ctx) = ctx.result.merge({ foo: "Foo" })
  end

  view :minimal do
    # extensions is a simple Array, so you can add or remove elements
    extensions.select! { |ext| ext.is_a? FooExtension }

    # or simply replace the whole Array
    self.extensions = [FooExtension.new]
  end
end
```

## Included extensions

These extensions are distributed with Blueprinter. Simply add them to your configuration.

### Field Order

Control the order of fields in your output. See [Fields API](../api/fields.md) for more information about the block parameters.

```ruby
extensions << Blueprinter::Extensions::FieldOrder.new { |a, b| a.name <=> b.name }
```

### MultiJson

The MultiJson extension switches Blueprinter from Ruby's built-in JSON library to the [multi_json](https://rubygems.org/gems/multi_json) gem. Just install the `multi_json` gem, your serialization library of choice, and enable the extension.

```ruby
extensions << Blueprinter::Extensions::MultiJson.new

# Any options you pass will be forwarded to MultiJson.dump
extensions << Blueprinter::Extensions::MultiJson.new(pretty: true)

# You can also pass MultiJson.dump options during render
WidgetBlueprint.render(widget, multi_json: { pretty: true }).to_json
```

If `multi_json` doesn't support your preferred JSON library, you can use Blueprinter's [json extension hook](../api/extensions.md#json) to render JSON however you like.

### OpenTelemetry

Enable the OpenTelemetry extension to see what's happening while you render your blueprints. One outer `blueprinter.render` span will nest various `blueprinter.object` and `blueprinter.collection` spans. Each span will include the blueprint/view name that triggered it.

Extension hooks will be wrapped in `blueprinter.extension` spans and annotated with the current extension and hook name.

```ruby
extensions << Blueprinter::Extensions::OpenTelemetry.new("my-tracer-name")
```

### ViewOption

The ViewOption extension uses the [blueprint](../api/extensions.md#blueprint) extension hook to add a `view` option to `render`, `render_object`, and `render_collection`. It allows V1-compatible rendering of views.

```ruby
extensions << Blueprinter::Extensions::ViewOption.new
```

Now you can render a view either way:

```ruby
# V2 style
MyBlueprint[:foo].render(obj)
# or V1 style
MyBlueprint.render(obj, view: :foo)
```

### blueprinter-activerecord

[blueprinter-activerecord](https://github.com/procore-oss/blueprinter-activerecord) is an official extension from the Blueprinter team providing ActiveRecord integration, including automatic preloading of associations based on your Blueprint definitions.
