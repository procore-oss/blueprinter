    # may return a modified (or new) object to be rendered.
    # @param object [Object] The object to be rendered
    # @param blueprint [Class] The Blueprinter class
    # @param view [Symbol] The blueprint view
    # @param options [Hash] Options passed to "render"
    # @return [Object] The object to continue rendering
