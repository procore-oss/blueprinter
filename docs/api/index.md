# Blueprinter API

Blueprinter has a rich API for extending the serialization process and reflecting on your blueprints.

## Extensions

The extensions API offers middleware for various parts of the serialization process. [Read more](./extensions.md).

## Reflection

The reflection API allows your application, or Blueprinter extensions, to introspect on your blueprints' options, fields, and views. [Read more](./reflection.md).

## Context Objects

Context objects are the arguments you'll receive in most of the above APIs. [Read more](./context-objects.md).

## Fields

Several APIs provide access to structs describing field definitions. [Read more](./fields.md).
